# Implementing-Load-Balancer-with-Nginx
Implementing Load Balancer with Nginx is a common task in many production environments.

## A. Introduction to Load Balancing and Nginx
Load balancing is the practice of distributing incoming network traffic or workload across multiple servers, services, or resources to ensure optimal utilization of resources, improve response times, maximize throughput, and enhance the reliability and availability of applications and services.

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is known for its ability to efficiently handle a large number of concurrent connections and serve web content quickly.

## B. Setting Up a Basic Load Balancer
We are going to be provisioning two EC2 instances running ubuntu 22.04 and install apache webserver in them. We will open port 8000 to allow traffic from anywhere, and finaly update the default page of the webservers to display their public IP address.

Next we will provision another EC2 instance running buntu 22.04, this time we will install Nginx and configure it to act as a load balancer distributing traffic across the webservers.

### 1. Provision EC2 Instances
EC2 instances are created through the AWS Management Console or CLI, allowing you to select configurations and enhance availability by placing them in specific Availability Zones. 

> Open your AWS Management Console, click on EC2. Scroll down the page and click on Launch instance:

> Under Applications and OS Images, click on quick start and click on ubuntu:

> Instances launched

### 2. Open Port 8000 in the security group of each of our webservers

To secure web traffic on port 8000, modify the associated security group's rules within the AWS EC2 dashboard, ensuring that access is restricted to trusted sources.

> Select your instance, scroll down the security tab, and select instance security group

> Modify access to allow traffic on port 8000

### 3. Install Apache Webserver

Configure Apache to serve a page showing its public IP: Customize Apache's configuration files to create a page that displays the server's public IP address, simplifying the verification of the Apache web server's functionality.

> SSH into these instances using putty or another terminal client (or use AWS's session manager).

> Update package list by running 

```
sudo apt update -y &&  sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

> Verify that apache is running using the command below

```
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
